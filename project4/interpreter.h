	A relation has a name, a header, and a set of tuples
	Write classes that implement a simple relational database. Your design must include at least the following classes: Database, Relation, Header, and Tuple. Provide functions in the Relation class for each of the relational operations (select, project, and rename). Each of these functions operates on an existing relation and returns a new Relation (the result of the operation).

	The Relation class must use a set data type to hold the tuples in the relation.
